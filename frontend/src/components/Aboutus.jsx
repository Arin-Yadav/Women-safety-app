            Our Women Safety WebApp is built with a clear mission: to empower
            women with technology that ensures safety, confidence, and peace of
            mind. We believe that everyone deserves to feel secure, whether at
            home, work, or traveling.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
            The app provides instant emergency alerts, live location tracking,
            and smart detection features designed to respond quickly in critical
            situations. By combining modern web technologies with thoughtful
            design, we aim to create a reliable companion that supports women in
            their daily lives.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
            Beyond safety, our vision is to foster awareness and build a
            community that values respect, equality, and empowerment. This
            project is more than just an app — it’s a step toward a safer and
            more inclusive world.
